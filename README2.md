IDEAMAGI-Cart-app.
This is a test project to demonstrate using Angular 15+. It contains all of the specs from Angular's test guide as well as some extras.

Get started

Install npm packages

npm install
ng serve

The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs lite-server on port 4200.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in package.json:

npm start - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
npm run build:watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into dist/.
npm run lint - runs tslint on the project files.
npm run serve - runs lite-server.

These are the test-related scripts:

npm test - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
npm run ci - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
